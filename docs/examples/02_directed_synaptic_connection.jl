# # Example 2: Directed Synaptic Connection (Two Neurons)
# 
# Now let's connect two neurons. This example introduces network assembly and 
# chemical synapses by linking a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic one via an 
# exponential synapse.
#
# Instead of building the HH channels from scratch like we did in Example 1, we'll 
# use the pre-built channels from the `MTKNeuralToolkit.HodgkinHuxley` standard 
# library to show how quickly you can spin up standard models.

# ## 2. Define the Synapse
# `ExpSynapse` is a continuous, sigmoid-driven exponential synapse. When the 
# presynaptic voltage crosses the threshold (`V_th`), the gating variable `s` 
# increases, injecting current into the postsynaptic compartment.

@named excitatory_synapse = ExpSynapse(g_max=2.0, τ=5.0, E_rev=0.0, V_th=-20.0, slope=2.0)

# !!! tip "Making an Inhibitory Synapse"
#     To make this synapse inhibitory, you just change `E_rev` to a value below 
#     the postsynaptic resting potential (e.g., `E_rev=-80.0`). No other code 
#     changes are needed.
#
# ```julia
# @named inhibitory_synapse = ExpSynapse(g_max=2.0, τ=5.0, E_rev=-80.0, V_th=-20.0, slope=2.0)
# ```

# !!! tip "Custom Synapses"
#     Look at the source code for `ExpSynapse`: it's pretty simple! You can modify the equations to make your own custom synapse. The interface is extremely flexible: you can have complicated multi-state synapses.

# ---

# ## 3. Wire the Network using SynapseSpec
# A `SynapseSpec` maps the pre- and post-synaptic voltages to the synapse block, 
# and designates which current variable in the postsynaptic compartment will 
# receive the injected current.

synapse_specs = [
    SynapseSpec(
        pre_neuron.interfaces.V,
        post_neuron.interfaces.V,
        post_neuron.interfaces.I_syn,
        excitatory_synapse
    )
]

# ---

# ## 4. Driving Stimuli
# We'll drive the presynaptic neuron with a time-varying sinusoidal current so 
# it spikes rhythmically. The postsynaptic neuron receives no external drive, 
# so any spiking it does is purely from the synaptic connection.

@named current_driver = Sine(amplitude=8.0, frequency=0.05, offset=8.0)

drivers = [(1, current_driver)]
